# Antigram ![alt text][logo] Chrome Extension 

Antigram is a chrome extension that gives the user tools to fight back Instagram's addictive features. It was made on my free time with the objective of being able to check what were my friends up to without falling into a blackhole of meaningless content.

##### Current features
- Explore Blocker
- Stories Blocker
- Suggestions Blocker
- Feed Blocker
- Background Color modification

##### Future features?
- Lock Settings
- Set timer
- Better feed visualization
- ... (I accept [suggestions](https://github.com/aymyo/antigram-extension/issues))

### Technology Used
- Javascript, HTML and plain CSS

### Setup
Download it from [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/antigram-explore-blocker/igbheapdmolhhmmklmkfjjjncmhihfjh "Chrome Store") or install it manually:

```
> Extract the content from the ZIP folder
> Open Chrome 
> Go to "Customize"
> Go to "More tools"
> Click "Extensions" 
> Toggle "Developer Mode" 
> Click on "Load unpacked" 
> Select this folder 
> Done!
```

### Warning
If it does not work, maybe it is because Instagram updated the web version and the elements to select changed. In that case, please check if you are using the last version of Antigram, and if that is the case, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/aymyo/antigram-extension/issues). Thank you

##### Sources and recommendations
This extension is mostly inspired by Jord West's [News Feed Eradicator](https://github.com/jordwest/news-feed-eradicator), which I recommend if you are a Facebook user. Additionally, I also recommend [DF Youtube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna) to have a better experience using Youtube.
